                <p>Thank you for choosing SlideChangerOnline. This policy outlines our position on refunds and cancellations for our Premium subscription service.</p>

                <h2>1. Subscription Service</h2>
                <p>SlideChangerOnline offers a paid "Premium" subscription which provides users with access to enhanced features. This is a digital service, and access is granted immediately upon successful payment.</p>

                <h2>2. No Refund Policy</h2>
                <p><strong>All sales are final. We do not offer refunds or credits for subscription fees.</strong></p>
                <p>We provide a comprehensive Free tier that allows all users to test the core functionalities of our service before committing to a paid subscription. We encourage you to use the Free tier to ensure that our service meets your needs before upgrading to the Premium plan. As the service is a digital product and access is provided instantly, we are unable to offer refunds once a payment has been made.</p>

                <h2>3. Cancellation Policy</h2>
                <p>You may cancel your Premium subscription at any time. Upon cancellation, you will continue to have access to Premium features until the end of your current billing period. At the end of the billing period, your account will be automatically downgraded to the Free tier, and you will not be charged again unless you choose to re-subscribe.</p>
                <p>To cancel your subscription, you will need to manage it through the account dashboard of our payment provider (Razorpay), or by contacting us for assistance.</p>
                
                <h2>4. Contact Us</h2>
                <p>If you have any questions about this policy, please contact us via the information provided on our Contact Us page before making a purchase.</p>
